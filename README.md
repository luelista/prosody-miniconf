teamwiki_chat
=============

``teamwiki-chat`` is a simple web-based chat built on nodejs and socket.io. I built it to be embedded in the sidebar of [teamwiki](https://teamwiki.de).

It can be easily extended to adapt to an existing user database.

It supports sending direct messages to users via ``@@username`` as well as ``@mentioning`` users in a message.
Also, it supports inserting images in a message from the clipboard (Chrome and Mozilla only atm).
